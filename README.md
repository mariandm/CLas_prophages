Code for: Functional and comparative genomic analysis of integrated prophage-like sequences in *Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus*
=============================
In this manuscript we re-examined prophage-sequences presence in all 15 CLas genomes available on NCBI using a *de novo* prediction approach. We expanded the number of prophage-like elements from 16 to 33. Further, we find that all CLas contain at least one prophage-like sequence. Comparative analysis reveals a prevalent, albeit previously unknown, prophage-like sequence type that is a remnant of an integrated prophage. Notably, this remnant prophage is found in the Ishi-1 CLas strain that11had previously been reported as lacking prophages. Our findings provide both a resource and new insights into the evolutionary relationship between phage and CLas pathogenicity.

Code Usage
=============================
All the scripts used to generate article's figures are written in R and/or Bash. The code was reviewed internally.

1. Run the script 'RunFigures.sh' in the 'CLas_code' directory to generate the figures from the article as well as supplementary figures. Figures will be automatically saved in 'CLas_code/Final_Figures_and_Tables' in 'pdf' formats.
2. The readme.txt file inside the 'CLas_code' directory contains further instructions.

'CLas_code' directory contains folders for each of the code generated figures and tables from the article. Each folder contains the files necessary to generate the paper's figures.
